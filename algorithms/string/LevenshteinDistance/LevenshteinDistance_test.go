================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Lack of input validation
Issue: The function does not validate the types or contents of its string inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if non-string or malicious inputs are provided.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the provided arguments are valid strings and sanitize them if necessary to prevent potential security risks.

Vulnerability: Integer overflow
Issue: The code uses uint16 for indexing, which may lead to an integer overflow if the input strings are longer than 65535 characters, potentially causing incorrect calculations or out-of-bounds memory access.
Solution: Use an integer type with a larger capacity, such as int or int64, to accommodate longer strings and prevent overflow.

Vulnerability: Potential denial of service
Issue: The algorithm's time complexity is O(n*m), where n and m are the lengths of the input strings. If excessively long strings are provided, it may lead to high CPU usage and a potential denial of service.
Solution: Implement rate limiting or input length checks to prevent the function from being called with excessively large strings that could impact system performance.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Identical strings

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function returns 0 when both input strings are identical, as the Levenshtein distance between two identical strings is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two identical strings as input parameters.
  Act: Invoke the `levenshteinDistance` function with these identical strings.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 0 using the `testing` package's equality assertion.
Validation:
  The assertion for equality to 0 is chosen because identical strings should have no differences, hence a Levenshtein distance of 0. This test is important to confirm that the function handles identical strings correctly, which is a basic and crucial aspect of the Levenshtein distance calculation.

Scenario 2: First string empty

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns the length of the second string when the first string is empty, as the Levenshtein distance in this case should be the number of insertions required to transform an empty string into the second string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an empty string as the first parameter and a non-empty string as the second parameter.
  Act: Invoke the `levenshteinDistance` function with these parameters.
  Assert: Ensure that the result equals the length of the second string.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the definition of the Levenshtein distance, where an empty string transformed into another requires as many insertions as the length of the other string. This test is critical to ensure that edge cases with empty strings are handled correctly.

Scenario 3: Second string empty

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the function returns the length of the first string when the second string is empty, which should match the number of deletions required to transform the first string into an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input a non-empty string as the first parameter and an empty string as the second parameter.
  Act: Invoke the `levenshteinDistance` function with the given parameters.
  Assert: Check that the result is equal to the length of the first string.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to verify that the function correctly computes the distance when one of the strings is empty. This test is important for validating that the function handles the other edge case with an empty string properly.

Scenario 4: Single character difference

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to confirm that the function returns 1 when the strings differ by exactly one character, which is the simplest case of a non-zero Levenshtein distance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two strings that are identical except for one character.
  Act: Call the `levenshteinDistance` function with these strings as parameters.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns a distance of 1.
Validation:
  The assertion for a result of 1 is based on the premise that a single substitution is needed to make the strings identical. This test is pivotal for verifying the function's ability to calculate the correct distance for minor differences between strings.

Scenario 5: Complete difference

Details:
  Description: This scenario checks if the function returns the length of the longer string when the two input strings have no characters in common, which is the maximum possible Levenshtein distance between two strings of given lengths.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use two strings with completely different characters.
  Act: Invoke the `levenshteinDistance` with these strings.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to the length of the longer string.
Validation:
  The assertion matches the expected outcome based on the definition of the Levenshtein distance, where the distance is the total number of insertions and deletions required to make the strings identical. This test is essential to ensure that the function correctly calculates the distance for completely different strings.

Scenario 6: Case sensitivity

Details:
  Description: This test determines whether the function is case-sensitive by using two strings that are identical except for the casing of the characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two strings that are identical except for the case of one or more characters.
  Act: Call the `levenshteinDistance` function with these strings as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a non-zero distance.
Validation:
  The choice of a non-zero result assertion is based on the assumption that the function should be case-sensitive, and thus consider differently cased characters as distinct. This test is important to confirm that the function takes character casing into account, which might be a desired feature depending on the application's requirements.

Scenario 7: Long strings performance

Details:
  Description: This test assesses the performance of the function when dealing with very long strings, which might be relevant for applications that need to process large amounts of text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate two very long strings with minor differences.
  Act: Invoke the `levenshteinDistance` function with these strings as parameters and measure the time taken.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns the correct distance within a reasonable time frame.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to ensure that the function not only computes the correct distance but also does so in a performant manner, which is critical for applications that process large datasets. This test is important for assessing the scalability of the function.

These scenarios cover a wide range of cases, including basic functionality, edge cases, performance, and real-world applicability. Each scenario is designed to validate a specific aspect of the `levenshteinDistance` function's behavior.
