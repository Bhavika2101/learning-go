================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Logging sensitive information
Issue: Using 'log.Fatal' for error handling may inadvertently log sensitive information since it prints the error message and stops the program.
Solution: Replace 'log.Fatal' with an error return value, allowing the caller to handle the error without leaking information.

Vulnerability: Inconsistent error handling
Issue: The function 'hammingDistance' does not return an error type, which is inconsistent with Go's idiomatic error handling practices.
Solution: Modify the function to return an error type along with the distance, allowing the caller to handle different lengths gracefully.

Vulnerability: Potential for unicode/UTF-8 issues
Issue: Comparing string lengths and indexing directly into the string assumes 1 byte per character, which is not true for multi-byte UTF-8 characters.
Solution: Use 'range' over the string to iterate over Unicode code points (runes) instead of bytes, and compare runes instead of bytes.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Equal strings with no differences

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function with two identical strings. The expected hamming distance should be 0 since both strings are equal and there are no character differences.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two identical strings `a` and `b`.
  Act: Invoke `hammingDistance(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned hamming distance is 0.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for an exact match of the returned value with the expected value (0). The test is important because it validates the base case where no differences should result in a hamming distance of 0.

Scenario 2: Strings with differences

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to verify that the function correctly calculates the hamming distance for two strings with a known number of character differences.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two strings `a` and `b` with a known number of different characters.
  Act: Invoke `hammingDistance(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned hamming distance matches the known number of differences.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms the correctness of the hamming distance calculation. This test is important for validating that the function performs as expected when there are character differences between the strings.

Scenario 3: Strings of different lengths

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the function logs a fatal error when the input strings are of different lengths, as the hamming distance is undefined in such cases.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two strings `a` and `b` of different lengths.
  Act: Invoke `hammingDistance(a, b)` and expect a log.Fatal call.
  Assert: Verify that a log.Fatal call is made with the appropriate error message.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function when provided with strings of different lengths. The test is crucial for confirming that the function does not attempt to calculate a hamming distance for strings that cannot be compared, which adheres to the definition of the hamming distance.

Scenario 4: Empty strings

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the function when provided with two empty strings. The expected hamming distance should be 0 as there are no characters to compare.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two empty strings `a` and `b`.
  Act: Invoke `hammingDistance(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned hamming distance is 0.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for an exact match of the returned value with the expected value (0). This test is important to ensure that the function handles edge cases of empty strings correctly.

Scenario 5: Case sensitivity check

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function is case-sensitive by providing two strings that are identical except for the case of the characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two strings `a` and `b` that are identical except that one is in uppercase and the other in lowercase.
  Act: Invoke `hammingDistance(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned hamming distance is equal to the length of the strings, assuming all characters differ only by case.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function treats characters of different cases as distinct. This test is important for validating the function's case sensitivity, which is a relevant characteristic for certain applications of the hamming distance.

Scenario 6: Special characters and spaces

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly handles strings containing special characters and spaces.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two strings `a` and `b` that include a variety of special characters and spaces, with some differences between them.
  Act: Invoke `hammingDistance(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned hamming distance matches the known number of differences that include special characters and spaces.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the function accurately calculates differences when special characters and spaces are involved. This test is important to ensure that the function is not limited to alphanumeric characters and can handle a wide range of input.

These scenarios cover a range of typical and edge cases, ensuring the robustness of the `hammingDistance` function.
