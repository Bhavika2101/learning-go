================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper error handling
Issue: The use of log.Fatal within the hammingDistance function stops program execution unexpectedly when strings of different lengths are passed in. This may lead to denial of service if used in a server environment or cause unintended side effects in a multi-threaded context.
Solution: Replace log.Fatal with error returning and let the calling function handle the error appropriately. A custom error type can be used for more context.

Vulnerability: Insecure interface design
Issue: The hammingDistance function does not have a clear way to report invalid usage to the caller, aside from crashing the program. This can be a misuse resistant issue, not directing the user properly.
Solution: Change the function signature to return an error alongside the distance value, and return a descriptive error when the input strings are of different lengths.

================================================================================
The package name for the file `hamming.go` is `HammingDistance`. Now, let's go ahead and craft the test scenarios for the `hammingDistance` function.

### Scenario 1: Identical Strings

Details:
  TestName: TestHammingDistanceIdenticalStrings
  Description: Testing the hammingDistance function with two identical strings. The expected result is a Hamming distance of 0 as there are no differences between the two strings.

Execution:
  Arrange: Two strings that are exactly the same, e.g., "test" and "test".
  Act: The function is invoked with the prepared strings as parameters.
  Assert: Use `if got := hammingDistance("test", "test"); got != 0 { t.Errorf("Expected 0, got %d", got) }` to verify that the returned distance is 0.

Validation:
  Justify: As both strings are identical, there are no positions at which the two strings differ. Therefore, the Hamming distance must be 0.
  Importance: It's essential to verify that when both inputs are identical, the Hamming distance is correctly calculated as 0, confirming the function's correctness for this base case.

### Scenario 2: Different Length Strings

Details:
  TestName: TestHammingDistanceDifferentLengths
  Description: Testing the hammingDistance function with strings of different lengths. As per the function's implementation, this should result in a logged fatal error stating that "Strings are of different length".

Execution:
  Arrange: Two strings of different lengths, e.g., "go" and "golang".
  Act: The function is invoked with the prepared strings as parameters. The act of invoking could be captured in a defer/recover pattern to handle the expected fatal error.
  Assert: Recovery from a panic (due to log.Fatal in the implementation) and checking that the recovered value is the expected log message.

Validation:
  Justify: Since the Hamming distance is only defined for strings of equal length, the attempted comparison of strings with differing lengths should result in an error. As implemented, this error is a logged fatal error, which must be captured and verified.
  Importance: Ensuring the function fails fast and appropriately when provided with inputs that don't meet its preconditions is critical for its reliability.

### Scenario 3: Different Strings with Hamming Distance

Details:
  TestName: TestHammingDistanceDifferentStrings
  Description: Testing the hammingDistance function with strings that differ by a certain number of characters, ensuring the function calculates the correct Hamming distance.

Execution:
  Arrange: Two strings that differ at certain positions, e.g., "karolin" and "kathrin".
  Act: The function is invoked with the prepared strings as parameters.
  Assert: Use `if got := hammingDistance("karolin", "kathrin"); got != 3 { t.Errorf("Expected 3, got %d", got) }` to verify that the returned distance is correct.

Validation:
  Justify: The provided parameters differ at exactly three positions, so the expected Hamming distance is 3. The test must confirm that the function accurately counts the number of differing positions.
  Importance: Verifying that the function accurately calculates the Hamming distance when there are character differences is essential, as this is the primary purpose of the function.

### Scenario 4: Strings with Special Characters

Details:
  TestName: TestHammingDistanceSpecialCharacters
  Description: Testing the hammingDistance function with strings containing special characters.

Execution:
  Arrange: Two strings containing special characters, e.g., "!@#$%^" and "^%$#@!".
  Act: The function is invoked with the prepared strings as parameters.
  Assert: Use `if got := hammingDistance("!@#$%^", "^%$#@!"); got != 6 { t.Errorf("Expected 6, got %d", got) }` to verify that the returned distance is 6, as every character differs.

Validation:
  Justify: Since every character differs between the strings, the expected Hamming distance is equal to the string length, which is 6 in this case. This test ensures the function can handle special characters.
  Importance: It is important to test the function with a variety of character types, including special characters, to validate its robustness.

Feel free to write additional scenarios, such as one with an empty string and non-ASCII characters, to make sure the `hammingDistance` function is thoroughly tested for all possible input varieties and edge cases.
