================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: log.Fatal usage leading to unexpected program exit
Issue: The use of log.Fatal within the hammingDistance function leads to the program exiting unexpectedly when the input strings are of different lengths. This can be an issue if the function is used in a larger application that shouldn't terminate.
Solution: Replace log.Fatal with an error return value, and handle the error appropriately in the caller context.

================================================================================
Based on the extracted Go code from `hamming.go` in the `HammingDistance` package, we can derive meaningful test scenarios for the `hammingDistance` function. Here are some test scenarios:

Scenario 1: ValidHammingDistanceCalculation
Details:
  TestName: TestHammingDistanceSameLengthStrings
  Description: This test examines the hammingDistance function by passing two strings of the same length and verifying if the function correctly calculates the Hamming distance between them.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two strings a and b of the same length with a known Hamming distance.
  Act: Call hammingDistance(a, b) to calculate the distance.
  Assert: Use Go's if statement to compare the returned distance with the expected value and call t.Error() if they do not match.
Validation:
  Justify: By testing with known values, we ensure that the function correctly computes the Hamming distance for the common case of equal-length strings.
  Importance: It's essential to validate the correctness of calculations that the algorithm is designed to perform, as this is the main functionality of the hammingDistance function.

Scenario 2: StringsOfDifferentLengths
Details:
  TestName: TestHammingDistanceDifferentLengthStrings
  Description: This test targets the error handling capabilities of the hammingDistance function by passing two strings of different lengths and verifying if it returns the appropriate error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two strings a and b of different lengths.
  Act: Invoke hammingDistance(a, b), capturing any log.Fatal output.
  Assert: Use a Go testing.T helper function to capture log output and assert that the expected fatal error message is emitted.
Validation:
  Justify: The function is expected to call log.Fatal when given inputs of differing lengths, so here we are validating that this edge case is correctly handled.
  Importance: Error handling is crucial as it prevents the application from executing invalid operations or returning misleading results.

Scenario 3: EmptyStrings
Details:
  TestName: TestHammingDistanceEmptyStrings
  Description: This test verifies the hammingDistance function's behavior when given two empty strings, an edge case where the distance should correctly be returned as 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two empty strings a and b.
  Act: Call hammingDistance(a, b) to calculate the distance.
  Assert: Ensure that the returned distance is zero using an if statement and t.Error().
Validation:
  Justify: An edge case that must be handled correctly to ensure the function behaves as expected in all valid scenarios.
  Importance: It tests the function's robustness and correctness in a boundary condition that could occur in normal operation.

Scenario 4: IdenticalNonEmptyStrings
Details:
  TestName: TestHammingDistanceIdenticalStrings
  Description: This test checks whether the hammingDistance function returns a distance of 0 for two identical non-empty strings.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two identical, non-empty strings a and b.
  Act: Run hammingDistance(a, b) to find the distance.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 0 using an if statement followed by t.Error() if the condition fails.
Validation:
  Justify: Two identical strings should have a Hammindistance of 0.
  Importance: This scenario verifies the basic premise that no changes mean no distance, a fundamental aspect of the Hamming distance concept.

These scenarios assume the package name `HammingDistance`, and the `hammingDistance` function that takes two strings as arguments. The assertions are based on the expected behaviors described and the structure of the Go testing framework, using `t.Error()` to report failures. The importance of each scenario highlights the expected functionality and the robustness of the application through different input conditions.
